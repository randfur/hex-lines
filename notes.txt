- Wondering about the number of draw calls since repeated shapes can't be instanced since instancing is already being used for the hex line itself.
  - Internet suggests 100s-1000 draw calls are okay.
  - Shouldn't be more than 100s of draw calls in the extreme case here. Should be alright.
- Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/randfur/hex-lines
- Recreated first hex from scratch with a couple of peeks at syntax from original experiment.

- Library version of [hex-lines-webgl](https://github.com/randfur/experiments/tree/main/2023/hex-lines-webgl).
- Unsure how to manage GPU memory.
- Going to go with very basic approach, everything is a separate buffer and needs to be drawn separately.
- Possible optimisation later if needed would be to bundle multiple things into one buffer.
  - Can probably add that as an additional API.
  - Create a bundle of handles that cannot be mutated.
  - Would be useful for plain playback separate from editing.
- API surface:
  - class HexLinesContext {
      constructor(HTMLCanvasElement);
      add(bufferData): HexLinesHandle;
    }
  - class HexLinesHandle {
      update(bufferData);
      draw();
      remove();
    }
- Every buffer needs to have the vertex attributes bound separately.
  - Using vertex array objects to save on the switching.
